        Pontianak, my hometown, is the capital city of West Borneo. It is a
        small, comfy town where there is everything you can find in a big modern
        city. It is also home to the fifth-longest river in East Asia, the
        Kapuas River. Being on the equator, it is also known for its warm
        tropical climate.
